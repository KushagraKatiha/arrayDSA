# Sorting In An Array

Sorting an array means to arrange the array in either increasing or in decreasing order, suppose we have an array :  
`arr = [20, 50, 11, 30, 5, -17, -100, 100, 64, 10]`  

The sorted array will look like :   

`arr = [-100, -17, 5, 10, 11, 20, 30, 50, 64, 100]` 
(Increasing Order)   
or  
`arr = [100, 64, 50, 30, 20, 11, 10, 5, -17, -100]`
(Decreasing Order)  

Now there are different methods to sort an array we will now discuss about them

## Methods to Sort an Array

There are two main methods to sort an array : 

<pre>
1 - Comparison Based Sorting
2 - Non-Comparison Based 
</pre>

### Comparison Based Sorting 

As the name suggests this sorting method is based on the comparision of the elements of the array, there are many methods which lies under this, main of them are :  
<pre>
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
Heap Sort
</pre>

These methods are used to sort an array, now you might think if by using any of the method we can sort the array so why are there different methods ??  

Here is the answer, these all methods have different approaches to sort an array which have different time and space complexities and in different scenarios we use different methods accordingly.

Here The "Quick Sort" and "Merge Sort" are the applications of the divide and conqure technique

## Non-Comparison Based Sorting

As the name suggests this type of sorting don't use comparison of array elements they have completely differet approach to sort an array, some main non-comparison based sorting methods are :  

<pre>
Count Sort
Radix Sort
Bucket Sort
</pre>
